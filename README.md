# Credit-Card-Fraud-Susceptibility

This is a machine learning-based web app that predicts the susceptibility of credit card transactions to fraud using transaction amount, age, and gender as key features. The project leverages the Kaggle dataset "Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection" and is implemented using a Streamlit app for showcasing real-time predictions and fraud analysis.

## Features

- Predict fraud susceptibility based on transaction amount, age, and gender.
- Bar charts visualizing fraud trends by age groups and gender.
- Machine learning models trained with Gradient Boosting for robust predictions.
- SMOTE technique applied for handling class imbalance in the dataset.
- Visualizations generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib for better understanding of the fraud patterns.

## Dataset

The project uses the ["Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) dataset from Kaggle, which includes features such as transaction amounts, customer demographics, and fraud labels.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Model:** Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Resampling Technique:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
